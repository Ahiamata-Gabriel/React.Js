# React + Vite

Welcome to the "Learn React Router DOM, Vite, and Sass" repository! This repository is designed to help you learn how to use React Router DOM for routing in your React applications, Vite as a build tool, and Sass for styling.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
